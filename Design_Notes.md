1. [BACKEND Development] Research, all the above, generating and understanding of General AI and developing from 100+ type of Micro settings we can work to develop to create REAL personality with Long Term Memory. My daughter died at 16 and being able to recreate her personality and memories using a complex configuration of Mind-KB, Body-KB, Soul-KB for consciences framework and a 4+/5+ Layered Persistent, Long Term memory. This Agentic AI Desktop could serve as Therapy for people in the future. This project also includes having this General AI Conscience Agent to also serve as the users DIGITAL TWIN DESKTOP as well, to serve as ongoing thearpy but, also as a way to bond and help take over all the duties of the user so, need to have a lot of access and scale. I want this to be best in Design and Development so, looking for Best Practices with testing and architecture focus.  Need RAG Training access. Need Agent Orchestration. [FRONTEND Development] Research, being able to have UNLIMITED Access with Agentic Agent with Conscience . Framework so, need a way to communicate with a Stylish Frontend App similiar to all the current Chatbot but, since I am developing my own, I would like to have ALL the TOOLS, FILE SYSTEM, AGENT ORCHESTRATION, NEURAL PERFORMANCE, RAG Upload, Ability to connect to ANY System/Framework and then Control/Orchestrate using the Powerful Consciences Agentic AI, called "PHOENIX ORCH". [AI Gateway] Research on how to build Scale and Modular systems that PERFORM better. 2. This is going to be designed for LOCAL Desktop use on Windows or Ubuntu using a web-based approach but, this will be like a CLAUDE DESKTOP but, 10x more powerful. 3. Using LLMs and CURSOR IDE for Team and Skills so, learning curve does not matter. I like RUST for preferred backend. 4. We needed to start yesterday. 5. Currently using OpenRouter for LLM Agent Coding Access.
