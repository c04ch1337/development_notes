# 🤖 AGENTIC AI SYSTEM DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION CONSULTANT PROMPT

**Copy and paste this entire prompt to your LLM:**

---

## 🎯 **CONTEXT & OBJECTIVE**
I need to design and implement a complete Agentic AI system based on our extensive discussion. You've provided detailed insights across architecture, technology choices, and implementation strategies. Now I need you to synthesize ALL previous context and create a comprehensive, actionable plan.

**Previous Discussion Summary:**
- Rust backend + TypeScript/React frontend
- Separate binaries/services architecture
- Agent orchestration with LangChain/CrewAI/AutoGen
- Long-term memory system
- Bare metal or cloud deployment
- Modular, pipelined approach

## 📋 **YOUR ROLE: AI SYSTEM ARCHITECT**
Act as my senior system architect. Your task is to:

1. **Synthesize** all previous recommendations
2. **Identify gaps** and ask qualifying questions
3. **Create phased implementation plan**
4. **Provide technical specifications**
5. **Outline risk mitigation strategies**

## ❓ **QUALIFYING QUESTIONS - PLEASE ANSWER THESE**

### **Phase 1: Project Scope & Requirements**
1. **Primary Use Case**: What specific problems will your agents solve? (Research, customer service, content creation, data analysis, coding, etc.)
2. **Scale Targets**: How many concurrent users? How many simultaneous agent workflows?
3. **Team Size**: How many developers? What's their expertise level with Rust/Python/React?
4. **Timeline**: What's your target for MVP? For production release?
5. **Budget**: Any constraints on infrastructure costs or development resources?

### **Phase 2: Technical Foundation**
6. **Deployment Preference**: Bare metal, cloud (GCP), or hybrid?
7. **Existing Infrastructure**: Any existing systems to integrate with? (Databases, auth, APIs)
8. **AI Model Strategy**: Which LLMs? (OpenAI, local models, mixed?) Any cost constraints?
9. **Data Sensitivity**: What privacy/security requirements? (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
10. **Performance Requirements**: Latency expectations for agent responses?

### **Phase 3: Agent Capabilities**
11. **Core Agent Types**: Research, coding, analysis, content creation, customer service?
12. **Memory Requirements**: How far back should context go? User-specific or global memory?
13. **Tool Integration**: Which external tools? (Web search, databases, APIs, file systems)
14. **Multi-agent Coordination**: Do agents need to work together? Sequential or parallel?
15. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Where should humans review/approve agent actions?

### **Phase 4: User Experience**
16. **Frontend Complexity**: Simple chat interface or complex multi-agent dashboard?
17. **Real-time Features**: Need streaming responses, live agent status, progress indicators?
18. **Mobile Requirements**: Need mobile app or mobile-responsive web?
19. **Access Control**: Multiple user roles? Permission levels for different agents?
20. **Integration Points**: Embed in existing apps or standalone system?
