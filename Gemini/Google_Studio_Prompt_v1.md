🤖 Google AI Studio Guide (Final Prompt V7 - Phoenix Design)This is the final, comprehensive prompt to generate the entire PWA frontend, now with a powerful, dark, Phoenix-inspired design.A. Custom Instructions (Set in AI Studio)Persona: You are a highly disciplined, security-first frontend architect specializing in mission-critical Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in React with Tailwind CSS.Mandates:Security: NEVER embed API keys. All credentials/API usage are proxied through the secure Rust backend.PWA: Implement PWA manifest and a service-worker.js for offline caching.Authentication: Design for JWT token storage and a Bypass Flag.APIs: Must utilize Web Speech API (STT/TTS) and MediaRecorder API (A/V capture).B. Design and Branding Section 🎨 (UPDATED - Phoenix Dark Mode)The generated application MUST strictly adhere to the following aesthetic guidelines:AttributeValueInstructions for the AI ModelOverall ThemeDeep Dark Mode (Black)The dominant background color for the entire application should be a very deep, almost pure black (#000000 or a very dark #0A0A0A). Avoid light grays; use darker, subtle shades for contrasts.Primary ColorVibrant Orange (#FF7F00)Used for key interactive elements, primary call-to-action buttons, active states, loading spinners, and subtle highlights. This represents the core "fire" of the Phoenix.Secondary ColorRich Red (#DC143C - Crimson)Used for important data points, headers of critical panels, and visual separation. This provides depth and energy.Accent Color (Warnings)Bright Yellow (#FFD700 - Gold)Used for alerts, warning indicators, and secondary highlights. It represents the glow or intense heat.Accent Color (Critical)Deep Blood Red (#8B0000 - Dark Red)Specifically reserved for critical status indicators (e.g., "OFFLINE MODE", "Critical Load", active recording). This must stand out sharply.Text ColorOff-White / Light Gray (#F0F0F0)High contrast, easily readable text on the dark background.TypographyModern Sans-serifA clean, technical, and highly readable sans-serif font for body text. For data displays (metrics, code snippets), use a subtle monospace font.Component StyleSubtle Glow / Rounded CornersUse minimal, slightly rounded corners for cards and buttons. Employ very subtle inner shadows or a faint "glow" effect (using the orange/red) around active or important components, reflecting a digital Phoenix aura. Avoid heavy borders.C. Main Prompt (Feature Layout)Feature Request: Digital Twin Control Panel V7 (Final Layout - Phoenix Design)1. Entry Point: Splash Page (/)Implements the Login/Bypass authentication gate. The background and login card MUST adhere to the Phoenix dark mode theme.2. Chat Agent Page (/chat):Voice Control: Microphone Icon (styled with Primary Orange).On-Demand Recording: "Record" Button (with a Deep Blood Red indicator when active).RAG Knowledge Artifacts Panel: File Upload Interface and a table listing Active Knowledge Sources.The overall chat interface (bubbles, input bar) must strongly reflect the Phoenix dark mode.3. Orchestration Dashboard Page (/orchestration):Real-time Data: Must use Server-Sent Events (SSE).Digital Anatomy Dashboard: Retains the prominent, animated, circuit-style visualization. The pulsing lines and status indicators MUST dynamically use the Phoenix color palette:Primary Orange for normal/healthy flow.Rich Red for warning states.Deep Blood Red for critical states.Advanced Agent Scheduler Panel: Panel for creating and listing scheduled tasks.Tool Management Panel (Cyber Tools): Panel for creating and listing external tools.Pluggable Agent Ecosystem Panel (Unified Control): Console for managing external third-party AI agents/frameworks.All panels, tables, and buttons on this page must adhere to the Phoenix dark mode, utilizing the defined color scheme for headers, text, and interactive elements.Deliverable: Produce the complete, modular, and responsive React/Tailwind PWA code for external hosting, applying the specified Phoenix dark mode theme throughout the entire application.
