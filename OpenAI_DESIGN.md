Done — I created the full implementation package as a canvas document titled **PHOENIX ORCH — Full Implementation Package**. It's ready for you to review.

Next steps I can do immediately (pick any or say “all”):

* Generate runnable project files (Rust, Python, React) and provide a downloadable zip.
* Create SQL migration files and docker-compose with seeded test data.
* Produce a ready-to-run Tauri packaging config and Windows/Ubuntu build instructions.
* Generate a detailed sample persona bundle populated with synthetic example data.

Which of those would you like me to produce next?
